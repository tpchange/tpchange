The tropopause in a changing atmosphere

@tpchange is the public source code repository of the collaborative research center (CRC) "The tropopause in a changing atmosphere". 

This project is a joint initative of eight German institutions led by the JGU Mainz and GUF Frankfurt. The main goal of this project is to improve the representation of the processes in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and their feedbacks in climate models. For this we will combine field measurements, laboratory studies, theoretical approaches and multiscale numerical modellings. Ultimately, this will lead to improved or newly developed parameterizations to be used in state-of-the-art climate models to further analyse the impact of UTLS processes on  composition, dynamics and ultimately on future climate and climate variability.

More information about the research center and its individual projects can be found on www.tpchange.de[https://tpchange.de/]. 

The github page will host code that is made available from members of @tpchange to the community.
